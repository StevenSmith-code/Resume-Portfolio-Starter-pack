    "bio": "Hi there! I am Steven! I've been coding for over 3 years now. I've started learning Java in highschool to get an overall grasp on how programming works coupled with taking computer science courses to help further my knowledge. I switched over to web development because I've always been curious of what goes on under the hood. I started with basic html and css and created a couple of static websites to get some experience and then I started to learn JavaScript! Javascript has open a lot of doors for me not only as a front-end developer, but for back-end as well especially with node.js and Mongodb. After creating websites with JavaScript I finally moved on to React and my passion for Web Development has only sky rocketed from there! as of now I am currently learning Next.js, MongoDB, Express, GraphQL, and Node.js!
